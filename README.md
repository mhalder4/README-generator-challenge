## Installation
The pertinent files for the project, including this README can all be found in the Github repository located at: https://github.com/mhalder4/README-generator-challenge.
## Usage
This program runs in the terminal using Node.JS and two Node packages. When the file is started, inquirer asks the user a series of questions regarding the desired content of their README. Once all the questions have been answered, a Markdown file is created for the README in the same folder as the original file.
